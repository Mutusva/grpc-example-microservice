# grpc-example-microservice
This is a small micro service build with golang to demonstrate how micro service can be exposed to interact with each other


The reason for this is to get feedback as to how best can one develop a golang micro services and have them communinate with each other through grpc.

There is still a lot of work to be done like 
 - using ssl certificates
 - logging
 - metrics
 - containerisation
 - building a CI/CD pipeline
